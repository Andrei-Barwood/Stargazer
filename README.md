🩸🍋 Alkalinizing Your Blood to Transform Your Life
The ability to synthesize and assimilate the principles and practices of this app into daily life should be reflected in real changes in your blood.
🧪 In Western medicine, blood pH is a primary marker of well-being, while Ayurvedic medicine maintains that blood balance determines a person's vitality and longevity.

Therefore, the app reads your pH level and acts as a holistic reminder:

If your pH is too acidic (⚠️), it reminds you that blood should be mostly alkaline to protect life and energy.

To alkalize your blood, it encourages the consumption of:

🍋 Lemons

🍊 Oranges

🥔 Potatoes

🌾 Wheat bran

🥗 Salads with green vegetables (exclusively green)

🥑 Avocados

🌱 Sprouts

🌶️ Green chilies

🫒 Olives or pistachios

☕ Yogi tea

🥕🍠🥬 Carrot juice, beet juice, celery juice, or a combination of the three.

From time to time, the app also reminds you of this Ayurvedic and medical principle 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️:

A vegetarian diet is good because:

🌬️ It helps regulate circulation and preserves the elasticity of the arteries.

💪 It makes you less susceptible to skin diseases, joint problems, and internal organ congestion.

♥️ It's an excellent way to avoid all heart diseases (yes, all heart diseases are associated with eating fried meat).

🛡️ It reduces the risk of cancer, kidney stones, and arteriosclerosis.

Remember:
Every day you choose alkaline food and a clear mind, your blood and your entire body are filled with vital energy.
This is the balance that Ayurveda and Western medicine agree is a priority for heart health, the happiness of your cells, and the strength of your spirit.
